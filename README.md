# FreeRTOS Device Control: UART, LED, and RTC

## Overview

This project implements a FreeRTOS application that takes user input (commands) over UART and handles the LED and real-time clock (RTC) peripherals on the STM32F411 Discovery development board.

## Technical Skills

- **Microcontroller**: STM32F411 Discovery board
- **RTOS**: FreeRTOS for task management, including Queues and Software Timers
- **Peripheral Integration**: RTC (Real-Time Clock), UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter), GPIO (General Purpose Input Output)
- **Programming Languages**: Embedded C
- **Development Tools**: STM32CubeMX, STM32CubeIDE
